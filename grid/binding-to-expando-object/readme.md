# Binding to Expando object

This example shows how to bind the TelerikGrid to Expando object. ExpandoObject is IDictionary<string, object> under the hood. This means that you can use the same approach to bind the grid to Dictionary too.

In this project you will find two examples with binding.

1. Binding to ExpandoObject and manually defining GridColumns
2. Binding to expando and automatically generate GridColumns

Key points:
   
- Setup a Grid with columns and define the `FieldType` parameter of each column. `FieldType` is mandatory parameter when you are using dynamic objects.

- Specify type of the `Data` to be `IEnumerable<ExpandoObject>`

- Customize the grid depending on your needs. You can set groping, sorting filtering, etc.

- If you need AutoGeneratedColumns, you have to [generate them by yourself](https://github.com/telerik/blazor-ui/tree/master/grid/binding-to-expando-object/BindingToExpandoObject/Pages/AutoGeneratedColumns.razor )
